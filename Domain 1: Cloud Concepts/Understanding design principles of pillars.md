### Understanding Design Principles of Each Pillar of AWS Well-Architected Framework

## Operational Excellence
- **Organizing teams around business outcomes**
    - achieving business outcomes stems from:
        - leadership vision
        - effective operations
        - business-aligned operating model
    - leadership should invest and commit to CloudOps transformations with a cloud operating model that incentives teams to operate efficiently and meet pre-defined business expectations.
        - the right operating model uses:
            - people, processes, and technology to scale
            - optimizes productivity
            - differentiates via agility, responsibilities, responsiveness, and adaptation
    - an organization's long term vision should be translated into goals, which are communicated to enterprises, stakeholders, and consumers
    - goals and operational KPIs should be aligned at all levels
- **implementing observability for actionable insights**
    - gaining comprehensive understanding of:
        - workloads
        - performance
        - reliability
        - cost
        - health
    - establishing **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** and leveraging observability telemetry to make informed decisions and take action when certain business outcomes are at risk.
        - **make proactive improvements of performance, reliability, and cost based on the actionably observability data**
- **automate whenever possible**
    - apply software engineering disciplines to environments in development
    - define the entire workload as code and update it
    - automate workload operations by initiating them as a response to certain events
    - you can deploy automation in the cloud safely by configuring guardrails such as:
        - rate control
        - error thresholds
        - approvals
    - effective automation allows:
        - consistent event response
        - limits human error
        - reduces operator toil
- **make small, frequent, and reversible changes**
    - this involves designing workloads that are scalable and loosely coupled, which allows components to update regularly
    - automated deployment techniques with smaller and incremental changes reduce blast radius and allows faster reversal in the event of a failure
    - making small changes increases the confidence to deliver changes to the workload while maintaining quality and adapting changes in market conditions
- **refine operations procedures frequently**
    - as workloads evolve, evolve operations
    - as operations procedures are used, look for opportunities to improve them
    - hold regular reviews and validate that all procedures are still effective and that teams are familiar with them
    - wherever gaps are identified, update those procedures
    - communicate all procedure changes to stakeholders and teams
    - game-ify operations to share the best practices and educate
- **anticipate failure**
    - practice failure scenarios to understand a workload's risk profile and it's business impact
    - test the effectiveness of procedures and how a team responds to failure
    - make informed decisions to manage risks identified by testing
- **learn from operational events and metrics**
    - drive improvement via lessons learned from operational events and failures
    - share lessons learned across teams and organization
    - lessons learned should highlight data and anecdote on how operations contribute to business outcomes
- **use managed services**
    - lower operational burden by using AWS services whenever possible. Make sure you build operational procedures around interactions with those services
